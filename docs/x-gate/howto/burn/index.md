1. On the Burn screen, select the token you want to burn.  
   **(Example) For "USDTX(ETH) → USDTX(JOC)"**  
   - Select **USDTX** for "From" (the token to burn).  
   - Select **ETH** for "To" (the token to receive).  
   - Enter the amount of **USDTX** you want to burn. (For example, entering "100 USDTX" will show the corresponding amount of ETH based on the exchange rate.)

2. A pop-up will appear in your wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

### **④ Verify the Transaction**

1. After completion, check if the ETH has been reflected in your wallet.  
2. Check the transaction on Etherscan ([https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/)).  
3. Copy the transaction ID (Tx Hash) from MetaMask's transaction history or Uniswap's "Transaction History".  
4. Search the Tx Hash on Etherscan to verify the transaction was successful.
