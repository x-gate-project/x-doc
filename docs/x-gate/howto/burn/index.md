2. Select MetaMask (or another supported wallet) and connect it.
3. Make sure you are connected to the correct network.

### **② Set Up the Token for Burn**

1. On the Burn screen, choose the token you wish to burn.  
   **Example:** For "USDTX(ETH) → USDTX(JOC)"
   - Select **USDTX** as "From" (the token to burn).  
   - Select **ETH** as "To" (the token to receive).  
   - Enter the amount of **USDTX** you desire to burn. For instance, entering "100 USDTX" will show the equivalent amount of ETH based on the current exchange rate.

3. Confirm the "minimum amount received," which can change based on market liquidity.

1. Click the "Burn" button.  
2. A pop-up will appear in your wallet (e.g., MetaMask).  
3. Review the gas fee and confirm the transaction.  
4. Wait for the transaction to process on the blockchain (this may take a few seconds to minutes).

### **④ Verify the Transaction**

1. After completion, check if ETH is now reflected in your wallet.  
2. Verify the transaction on Etherscan ([https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/)).  
3. Copy the transaction ID (Tx Hash) from MetaMask's transaction history or Uniswap's "Transaction History."  
4. Search the Tx Hash on Etherscan to ensure the transaction was successful.
