# Pool  

**A pool (liquidity pool) is a mechanism that provides the liquidity (token supply) necessary for cryptocurrency trading.**  

In DEXs (decentralized exchanges) like X-Swap, users can **earn transaction fees by depositing cryptocurrency into liquidity pools**.  


## **① Connect Your Wallet**  

1. Click **"Connect Wallet"**.  
2. Select and connect **MetaMask** or another supported wallet.  
3. Ensure you are connected to the correct network, such as **Ethereum Mainnet or BSC**.  


## **② Add Liquidity**  

1. Open the **"Pool"** tab.  
2. Select **"Add Liquidity"**.  
3. Choose the **token pair** you want to provide liquidity for.  
   - **Example:** USDT / ETH  
   - The pair must be provided in a **1:1 ratio**.  
   - **Example:** Enter **100 USDT** and the equivalent amount of ETH.  
4. Enter the amount and check the **pool share (LP token ratio)**.  
5. Click **"Approve"** to allow token usage in your wallet.  
6. Click **"Supply"** to approve the transaction.  
7. Confirm the **gas fee** and finalize the transaction.  


## **③ Check Earned Rewards**  

- Each time a swap occurs, liquidity providers receive a **portion of the transaction fee (e.g., 0.3%)**.  
- Rewards accumulate based on the duration of liquidity provision.  
- **LP tokens** are required when withdrawing liquidity.  


## **④ Remove Liquidity**  

1. Open the **"Pool"** tab.  
2. Select your **liquidity pair**.  
3. Click **"Remove"**.  
4. Choose the withdrawal percentage (**e.g., 100% for full withdrawal**).  
5. Approve the transaction in your wallet.  
6. Your original tokens (**USDT & ETH**) plus earned rewards will be returned to your wallet.  

**Note:**  
- The amount of tokens withdrawn may vary due to **impermanent loss**.  
- Holding liquidity for a longer period can **increase fee rewards**.
