# Pool  

A **liquidity pool** is a mechanism that provides the essential liquidity (token supply) for cryptocurrency trading.

On DEXs (decentralized exchanges) such as X-Swap, users can earn transaction fees by depositing cryptocurrency into these liquidity pools.  

## **① Connect Your Wallet**  

1. Click **"Connect Wallet"**.  
2. Select and connect **MetaMask** or another supported wallet.  
3. Ensure you are connected to the correct network, such as **Ethereum Mainnet or BSC**.  

## **② Add Liquidity**  

1. Open the **"Pool"** tab.  
2. Select **"Add Liquidity"**.  
3. Choose the **token pair** you wish to provide liquidity for.  
   - **Example:** USDT / ETH  
   - The pair must be provided in a **1:1 ratio**.  
   - **Example:** Enter **100 USDT** and the equivalent amount in ETH.  
4. Enter the amount and check your **pool share (LP token ratio)**.  
5. Click **"Approve"** to enable token usage in your wallet.  
6. Click **"Supply"** to authorize the transaction.  
7. Confirm the **gas fee** and finalize the transaction.  

## **③ Check Earned Rewards**  

- Every time a swap occurs, liquidity providers earn a **portion of the transaction fee (e.g., 0.3%)**.  
- Rewards accumulate based on how long liquidity is provided.  
- **LP tokens** are necessary when withdrawing liquidity.  

## **④ Remove Liquidity**  

1. Open the **"Pool"** tab.  
2. Select your **liquidity pair**.  
3. Click **"Remove"**.  
4. Choose the withdrawal percentage (**e.g., 100% for a full withdrawal**).  
5. Approve the transaction in your wallet.  
6. Your original tokens (**USDT & ETH**), along with earned rewards, will be returned to your wallet.  

**Note:**  
- The amount of tokens withdrawn may differ due to **impermanent loss**.  
- Maintaining liquidity over a longer period can increase your fee rewards.
