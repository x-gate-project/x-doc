# About the X-Gate Project

This project provides a platform through two DeFi services, X-Gate and X-Swap, for the issuance of two stablecoins, USDTX and USDCX, their transfer across multiple networks, and exchange into other cryptocurrencies.

**What is USDTX / USDCX?**

USDTX / USDCX are stablecoins that are pegged 1:1 with USDT / USDC, and can be transferred across multiple networks. They are issued by locking USDT / USDC, which are US dollar-backed stablecoins on the Ethereum network.

Through this project, USDTX / USDCX can be sent to other networks and exchanged for other cryptocurrencies, including USDT / USDC.
