# About X-Swap

X-Swap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that supports multiple networks including Ethereum and Japan Open Chain. Without a central governing party, users can leverage their own wallets to execute cross-asset swaps (Swap) or provide liquidity for token pairs (Pool) via smart contracts.

**Exchange Between Different Cryptocurrencies (Swap)**

Swap refers to the act of converting one cryptocurrency into another. On X-Swap, you can effortlessly exchange tokens directly with each other by utilizing smart contracts.

**Providing Liquidity (Pool)**

Pool serves as the reservoir of funds that supplies the necessary liquidity for Swaps. By depositing cryptocurrencies into a Pool as liquidity providers, users can earn transaction fees as rewards.
