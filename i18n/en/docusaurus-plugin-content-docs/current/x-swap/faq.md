A gas fee is the transaction fee required to execute operations on a blockchain.  

Since executing a transaction consumes computational resources, a fee must be paid as compensation.  

The gas fee varies depending on the type of transaction and network congestion.  

### **The transaction is not reflected in my wallet.**
