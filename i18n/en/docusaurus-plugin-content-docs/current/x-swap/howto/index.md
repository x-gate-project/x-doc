# How to Use X-Swap

## How to Use Swap

**Swap refers to exchanging one cryptocurrency for another.**

Unlike centralized exchanges (CEX), decentralized exchanges (DEX) like X-Swap do not use an order book but instead utilize **liquidity pools** to exchange tokens.

**① Connect Your Wallet (such as MetaMask)**

1. Click "Connect Wallet."
2. Choose and connect to MetaMask (or another supported wallet).
3. Ensure you are connected to the correct network.

**② Set the Tokens to Swap**

1. Select the tokens you want to swap on the swap screen.
**Example: "USDT → ETH"**
Choose USDT as "From" and ETH as "To." Enter the amount of USDT you want to exchange.
Example: Entering "100 USDT" will show the equivalent ETH based on the rate.
2. Review the price, gas fees, and slippage.
3. Check the "Minimum Received Amount," which may vary due to market liquidity.

**③ Execute the Swap**

1. Click the "Swap" button.
2. A pop-up from your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) will appear.
3. Review and confirm the gas fees.
4. Wait for the transaction to be processed on the blockchain (this may take a few seconds to minutes).

**④ Confirm the Transaction**

1. Once the swap is complete, verify that the ETH is reflected in your wallet.
2. Check the transaction on Etherscan ([https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/)).
3. Copy the transaction ID (Tx Hash) from your MetaMask or Uniswap transaction history.
4. Search on Etherscan to confirm the transaction's success.

## How to Use Pool

A **Pool (Liquidity Pool)** is a mechanism that provides the necessary liquidity (token supply) for cryptocurrency trading.

In a DEX like X-Swap, you can **earn trading fees by depositing cryptocurrency into a liquidity pool.**

**① Connect Your Wallet**

1. Click "Connect Wallet."
2. Choose and connect to a wallet such as MetaMask.
3. Ensure you are connected to the correct network, such as Ethereum Mainnet or BSC.

**② Add Liquidity**

1. Open the "Pool" tab.
2. Select "Add Liquidity."
3. Choose the token pair you wish to provide liquidity for (e.g., USDT / ETH).
    - The pair must be provided at a 1:1 ratio.
    - Example: Enter 100 USDT and the corresponding amount of ETH.
4. Input the amounts and check the pool share (LP token ratio).
5. Click "Approve" to permit token usage from your wallet.
6. Click "Supply" to approve the transaction.
7. Review the fees (gas fees) and give final approval.

**③ Check Earned Rewards**

- Each time a swap occurs, the transaction fee (around 0.3%) is distributed to liquidity providers.
- Rewards accumulate based on the time liquidity is provided.
- LP tokens are required when withdrawing liquidity.

**④ Remove Liquidity**

1. Open the "Pool" tab.
2. Select the liquidity pair you are providing.
3. Click "Remove Liquidity."
4. Choose the withdrawal percentage (e.g., 100% for full).
5. Approve the transaction with your wallet.
6. The original tokens (USDT and ETH) plus earned rewards will be returned to your wallet.

- Note that the amount of deposited tokens may change due to swaps (impermanent loss).
- Providing liquidity over a longer period increases rewards from transaction fees.
