# Swap

**Swap refers to the process of exchanging one cryptocurrency for another.**

Unlike centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like X-Swap do not use order books but instead utilize **liquidity pools to facilitate token swaps**.

### **① Connecting Your Wallet (e.g., MetaMask)**

1. Click on "Connect Wallet."
2. Select MetaMask or another compatible wallet and connect it.
3. Ensure you are connected to the correct network.

### **② Setting the Tokens for Swap**

1. On the swap screen, select the tokens you wish to swap.
**Example: For "USDT → ETH,"**
Select USDT in "From" (sending).
Select ETH in "To" (receiving). Enter the amount of USDT you wish to swap.
(Example: Entering "100 USDT" will display the equivalent ETH based on the rate.)
2. Check the price, gas fee, and slippage.
3. Verify the "Minimum Received Amount" (may vary with market liquidity).

### **③ Executing the Swap**

1. Click the "Swap" button.
2. A MetaMask (or other wallet) popup will appear.
3. Review the gas fee and approve the transaction.
4. Wait for the transaction to be processed on the blockchain (this might take a few seconds to minutes).

### **④ Verifying the Transaction**

1. After completion, check that the ETH is reflected in your wallet.
2. Verify the transaction on Etherscan ([https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io)).
3. From the transaction history of MetaMask or Uniswap's "transaction history," copy the transaction ID (Tx Hash).
4. Search on Etherscan to confirm if the transaction was successful.
