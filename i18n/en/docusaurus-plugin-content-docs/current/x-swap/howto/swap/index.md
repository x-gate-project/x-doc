# Swap  

**Swapping is the process of exchanging one cryptocurrency for another.**  

Unlike centralized exchanges (CEX), **decentralized exchanges (DEX)** like X-Swap do not use an order book. Instead, they **utilize liquidity pools** to facilitate token swaps.  


## **① Connect Your Wallet (MetaMask, etc.)**  

1. Click **"Connect Wallet"**.  
2. Select **MetaMask** (or another supported wallet) and connect.  
3. Ensure you are connected to the correct network.  


## **② Select Tokens for Swap**  

1. On the swap screen, choose the tokens you want to exchange.  
   - **Example: Swapping USDT for ETH**  
   - Select **USDT** in the "From" field.  
   - Select **ETH** in the "To" field.  
   - Enter the amount of USDT you want to swap (e.g., **100 USDT**, which will display the equivalent ETH based on the current rate).  
2. Check the **price, gas fee (transaction fee), and slippage tolerance**.  
3. Confirm the **minimum amount you will receive** (varies based on market liquidity).  


## **③ Execute the Swap**  

1. Click the **"Swap"** button.  
2. Your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) will prompt you for confirmation.  
3. Review the **gas fee** and confirm the transaction.  
4. Wait for the transaction to be processed on the blockchain (**this may take a few seconds to a few minutes**).  


## **④ Verify Your Transaction**  

1. After the swap is complete, check if **ETH is reflected in your wallet**.  
2. Verify the transaction on **Etherscan** ([https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/)).  
3. Copy the **Transaction ID (Tx Hash)** from **MetaMask's transaction history** or Uniswap’s **transaction records**.  
4. Search the Tx Hash on **Etherscan** to confirm whether the transaction was successful.
