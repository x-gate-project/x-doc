# Swap  

**Swapping refers to exchanging one cryptocurrency for another.**  

Unlike centralized exchanges (CEX), **decentralized exchanges (DEX)** like X-Swap do not rely on an order book. Instead, they utilize **liquidity pools** to facilitate token swaps efficiently.

## **① Connect Your Wallet (MetaMask, etc.)**  

1. Click **"Connect Wallet"**.  
2. Select and connect your wallet, such as **MetaMask**.  
3. Ensure you are connected to the appropriate network.  

## **② Select Tokens for Swap**  

1. On the swap screen, choose the tokens you want to exchange.  
   - *Example: Swapping USDT for ETH*  
   - Select **USDT** in the "From" field.  
   - Select **ETH** in the "To" field.  
   - Enter the amount of USDT to swap (e.g., **100 USDT**; the equivalent amount in ETH will be displayed based on the current rate).  
2. Check the **price, gas fee (transaction fee), and slippage tolerance**.  
3. Confirm the **minimum amount you will receive**, which may vary based on market liquidity.  

## **③ Execute the Swap**  

1. Click the **"Swap"** button.  
2. Confirm the transaction in your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) when prompted.  
3. Review the **gas fee** and confirm the transaction.  
4. Wait for the transaction to process on the blockchain (this might take a few seconds to a few minutes).  

## **④ Verify Your Transaction**  

1. After the swap is complete, check if **ETH is reflected in your wallet**.  
2. Verify the transaction status on **Etherscan** ([https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/)).  
3. Copy the **Transaction ID (Tx Hash)** from **MetaMask's transaction history** or Uniswap’s **transaction records**.  
4. Search the Tx Hash on **Etherscan** to confirm the transaction was successful.
