# Pool

**A Pool (Liquidity Pool) is a mechanism that provides the liquidity (supply of tokens) needed for cryptocurrency trading.**

In a DEX (Decentralized Exchange) like X-Swap, you can **earn trading fees by depositing cryptocurrencies into a liquidity pool.**

### **① Connect Wallet**

1. Click on "Connect Wallet."
2. Select MetaMask or another compatible wallet and connect it.
3. Ensure you are connected to the target network, such as Ethereum Mainnet or BSC.

### **② Add Liquidity**

1. Open the "Pool" tab.
2. Select "Add Liquidity."
3. Choose the token pair you want to provide liquidity for (e.g., USDT / ETH).
    - You need to provide the pair in a 1:1 ratio.
    - Example: enter 100 USDT and the corresponding amount of ETH.
4. Enter the amount and verify the pool share (the proportion of LP tokens).
5. Click "Approve" to allow the use of the tokens in the wallet.
6. Click "Supply" to approve the transaction.
7. Confirm the fees (gas fee) and finalize the approval.

### **③ Check Earned Rewards**

- Every time a swap occurs, transaction fees (such as 0.3%) are distributed among the liquidity providers in the pool.
- Rewards accumulate based on the duration of liquidity provision.
- LP tokens are necessary when withdrawing liquidity.

### **④ Remove Liquidity**

1. Open the "Pool" tab.
2. Select the liquidity pair you are providing.
3. Click "Remove" to retract liquidity.
4. Choose the amount to withdraw (e.g., 100% for full withdrawal).
5. Approve the transaction in the wallet to confirm it.
6. The original tokens (USDT and ETH) plus earned rewards will return to your wallet.

- The amount of deposited tokens might change due to the impact of swaps (impermanent loss).
- Holding liquidity over a longer period can increase the rewards from transaction fees.
