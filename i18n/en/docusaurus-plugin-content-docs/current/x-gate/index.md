# What is X-Gate?

X-Gate is a system designed for **bridging (transferring) stablecoins (USDTX, USDCX) between different networks**.

This allows users to **seamlessly move assets across multiple networks**, enabling smoother transactions and better access to DeFi (decentralized finance) applications.
