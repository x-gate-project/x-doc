# About X-Gate

X-Gate is a DeFi service that facilitates cross-network transfer (Send), issuance (Mint), and exchange to USDT / USDC (Burn) of USDTX / USDCX.

**Cross-Network Transfer (Send)**
The Send feature allows USDTX / USDCX to be transferred freely between networks supported by X-Gate. Transfers can be made not only within the same wallet but also to a different wallet address.

**Issuance (Mint)**

By locking USDT / USDC on the Ethereum network, an equivalent amount of USDTX / USDCX can be issued on the designated network.

**Exchange to USDT / USDC (Burn)**

This feature allows USDTX / USDCX on any network to be exchanged into USDT / USDC on the Ethereum network.
