# What is X-Gate?

X-Gate is a system designed to **bridge (transfer) stablecoins (USDTX, USDCX) between different networks**.

This allows users to **seamlessly transfer assets across multiple networks**, facilitating smooth transactions and utilization of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications.
