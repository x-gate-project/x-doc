# What is X-Gate?

**X-Gate is a system designed for bridging (transferring) stablecoins (USDTX, USDCX) across different networks.**

This enables users to **seamlessly move assets across multiple networks**, providing smoother transactions and better access to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.
