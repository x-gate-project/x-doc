3. Ensure you are connected to the correct network.

### **② Set Up the Token for Sending**

1. On the Send screen, choose the token you wish to send.  
   **(Example) Sending "USDTX (ETH) to USDTX (JOC)"**  
   - Select **USDTX** for "From" (the token you are sending).  
   - Select **ETH** for "To" (the network/token to receive in exchange).  
   - Enter the amount of **USDTX** you want to send. (For instance, entering "100 USDTX" will display the corresponding amount of ETH based on the current exchange rate.)

2. Review the price, gas fees (transaction fees), and slippage.  
3. Confirm the "minimum amount to be received" (which can vary with market liquidity).

### **③ Execute the Send (Transfer)**

1. Click the "Send" button.  
2. A pop-up will appear in your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to initiate the transaction.  
3. Review the gas fee and confirm the transaction.  
4. Wait for the transaction to process on the blockchain (it might take a few seconds to a few minutes).

### **④ Verify the Transaction**

1. After the transaction is complete, check if the ETH is reflected in your wallet.  
2. Verify the transaction on Etherscan ([https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/)).  
3. Copy the transaction ID (Tx Hash) from your wallet's transaction history.  
4. Enter the Tx Hash on Etherscan to ensure the transaction was successful.
