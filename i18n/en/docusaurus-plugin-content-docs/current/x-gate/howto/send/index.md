# Send

## How to Use the Send Function (Inter-Network Transfer)

1. In the "Send" screen, select the source (From) and destination (To) networks and tokens from the dropdown menus. The transfer feature only supports inter-network transfers of the same token. The tokens displayed in the destination (To) dropdown menu will change based on the token chosen in the source (From) menu, so select the network and token for the source (From) first, then choose the destination (To).

2. Enter the amount you wish to transfer in the quantity input field of the source (From) network. Upon entering, the same amount will be displayed in the destination (To) quantity field. If you wish to transfer to a different address, check "Send to another address" to reveal the address input field for the destination address.

3. Click the "Send" button. After clicking, a wallet popup will appear for you to review the fees and other details, and approve the transaction.
4. Once the transaction is processed on the blockchain, it will be reflected in your wallet. Depending on blockchain congestion, processing may take from a few seconds to several minutes.
