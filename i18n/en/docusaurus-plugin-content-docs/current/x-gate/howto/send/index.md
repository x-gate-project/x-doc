3. Ensure you are connected to the correct network.

### **② Set Up the Token for Send (Transfer)**

1. On the Send screen, choose the token you wish to send.  
   **(Example) For "USDTX(ETH) → USDTX(JOC)"**  
   - Select **USDTX** for "From" (the token to send).  
   - Select **ETH** for "To" (the token to receive).  
   - Enter the amount of **USDTX** you want to send. (For example, entering "100 USDTX" will show the corresponding amount of ETH based on the exchange rate.)

2. Check the price, gas fees (transaction fees), and slippage.  
3. Review the "minimum amount received" (which can vary based on market liquidity).

### **③ Execute Send (Transfer)**

1. Click the "Send" button.  
2. A pop-up will appear in your wallet (e.g., MetaMask).  
3. Review the gas fee and confirm the transaction.  
4. Wait for the transaction to be processed on the blockchain (which may take a few seconds to minutes).

### **④ Verify the Transaction**

1. After completion, check if the ETH has been reflected in your wallet.  
2. Check the transaction on Etherscan ([https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/)).  
3. Copy the transaction ID (Tx Hash) from MetaMask's transaction history or Uniswap's "Transaction History".  
4. Search the Tx Hash on Etherscan to verify the transaction was successful.
